Okay wow, it feels so good to be back after a day and half of trying to move the stack in various directions. Though nothing significant was achieved, we were able to understand why such ideas are fruitless, especially in the short to medium term. In the longer term such tangents might gain a lot more importance, but for now, we are going in the right direction. Only thing thats worth adding now is the electron framework to make my web app into a deskptop app - which might be a lot more naturall for my usecases.
